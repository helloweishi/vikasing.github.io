{"name":"NiceText","tagline":"A Java based webpage text extraction lib","body":"### NiceText Repo Link: [https://github.com/vikasing/NiceText](https://github.com/vikasing/NiceText)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## What is NiceText?\r\nIts a small Java based library to extract main content from a web page, it removes HTML, JS, CSS and other text clutter from an HTML document. It extracts the main text from a webpage based on text density of the different part of the webpage and later clustering these regions to find the largest and most appropriate region.\r\n\r\n## How to use NiceText?\r\nRight now you can download 2 files `NiceTextType.java` and `HTMLHelper.java`, include them in your project and do the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nHTMLHelper htmlHelper = new HTMLHelper();\t\t\r\nNiceTextType niceTextType = htmlHelper.getNiceText(\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/how-edward-j-snowden-orchestrated-a-blockbuster-story.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\");\r\nSystem.out.println(niceTextType.getArticleText());\r\nSystem.out.println(niceTextType.getNiceText());\r\nSystem.out.println(niceTextType.getLargestTextBlock());\r\n```\r\n_I'm still working on the improvements and tweaks, with the addition of new Classes above code is most likely to change._\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nNiceText finds the text density of different regions on a webpage and tries to determine the largest region buy using clustering. This large region or cluster is chosen as the maintext or `niceText`.\r\n\r\n_I'll write a detailed post on how it works sometime in future._\r\n\r\nThere is also a method `getArticleText()` which just tries to find out an article region by looking at the tag names, class names and ids, e.g. it looks for following words:\r\n`article|section|content|page|post|...`\r\nIt sometimes produces bad results but is faster than the `getNiceText()`.\r\n\r\nYou may also try `getAllText()` to get all the text of a webpage.\r\n\r\n## License \r\nI have yet to decide on the license, but it will be free for both commercial as well as free usage.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nLeave a comment, report an issue at the repo page, fork it to make it better or worse.
